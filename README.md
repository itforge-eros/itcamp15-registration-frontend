# register.itcamp.in.th - ITCAMP 15 Registration Frontend

This is the registration frontend that will be used for the upcoming ITCAMP 15.

## Task Checklist

The upgraded code is still a mess of untyped stuff; please feel free to add type annotations and refactor accordingly.

Also, some bugs may occur from upgrading all dependencies to their latest major version.

- [ ] Add more TypeScript type annotations.
- [ ] Re-enable type checking service once all type annotations are properly added.
- [ ] Change Firebase, Segment, Sentry and FullStory API Key and Account.
- [ ] Update design and form to match JWC CI and requirements.
- [ ] Add some unit and/or integration tests! (I recommend `jest + react-testing-library`)
